Challenges:
  Personal: 
    My father passing away when I was 9. 

  Professional: 
    Getting through the risk management & insurance program (especially "boot camp" which was the introductory courses which were made to be very challenging while also being very invovled in the student professional organization tied to the program). 

  How Did I Get Through Them?:
    I think in general I am good at "seeing the light at the end of the tunnel" as well as just staying positive. Although I get stressed at times, I have a resounding belief that everything will be okay in the end. 

What do you appreciate most about yourself?
  I am generally able to become friends with anyone. I don't take things too seriously. I am curious about just about everything. I learn quickly and can learn on my own. I appreciate that I can interview well too, or at least have in the past.
  
What don't you appreciate?
  I procrastinate. I also don't think I ask for help as often as I should, although on the other hand I've always enjoyed figuring things out on my own so that has helped me at times.


Some times you've felt uncomfortable / anxious / frustrated? How do you know you are feeling those things? what sensations from your body?
  I think a commone one is at work, in meetings, when I don't know the answer to something but feel that I should. Often, even if I know the answer I will second guess myself. My heart will often start beating fast immediately, I may get a little flush in the face or even start sweating a little bit. It seems so silly, especially if I know the right response.

  Another one is when I feel overwhelmed at work from too many things to do in too little time. If I don't step back and re-prioritize I often find myself almost "shutting down" and being unable to even taking actions. 

How do you cope with those feelings and what are ways in which you are able to move towards your goals despite those feelings?
  For not knowing something, I am trying to be more honest / upfront. For being overwhelmed...also trying to be more upfront and asking for help. but just stepping way to re-prioritize.
